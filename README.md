### **Project Title**
*Bikeshare Data*

### **Description**
*This project analyzes bikeshare usage data from three major US cities: Chicago, New York City, and Washington. The goal is to uncover patterns in bikeshare usage by computing various statistics such as popular travel times, common stations, trip durations, and user demographics.*

*The script is interactive, allowing users to filter the data by:*

*City: Chicago, New York City, or Washington.*
*Month: January through June, or all months.*
*Day of the Week: Monday through Sunday, or all days.*
*After applying filters, the script displays statistics and can optionally show raw data in chunks of 5 rows.*

### **Files used**
- bikeshare.py (script file)
- chicago.csv, new_york_city.csv, washington.csv (datasets)


### **Credits**
*This project was completed as part of the Udacity Data Science Nanodegree. The dataset used in this project is provided by Motivate, a bike-share system provider.*
*Special thanks to Udacity and the open-source community for the guidance and resources (https://www.udacity.com/).*
